/*
 * Functionality for hazard pointers, aka safe memory reclamation (SMR).

 * Uses a linked list for the hazard poitners. Using an array can be a 
 * related experiment.

 * Follows the pseudocode given in :
 *  M. M. Michael. Hazard Pointers: Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock-Free 
 *  Objects. IEEE TPDS (2004) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed 
 *  Systems 15(8), August 2004.
